OSMAN is a agenda made for students by students. It contains a lesson manager, schedule creator, grade storage and calculator, exam and to-do reminder and a text or HTML file viewer.

OSMAN makes student's life easier before. Because:
  * with our *lesson management* module, you can add your lessons
  * using data from _lesson manager_, you can *create your weekly schedule*
  * you may *store your grades and calculate your average*
  * thanks to *note viewer* you can read text and HTML files even if you're offline
  * it reminds you your exams and to-dos.

Also OSMAN has a cool menu so it is not hard to find the module you want to use.

_PS: Of course you have to save the HTML file you want to view when you're online._
